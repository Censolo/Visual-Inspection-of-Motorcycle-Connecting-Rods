# Visual Inspection of Motorcycle Connecting Rods
Computer Vision visual inspection software system aimed at visual inspection of motorcycle connecting rods.

The system is able to analyse the dimensions of two different types of connecting rods to allow a vision-guided robot to pick and sort rods based on their type and dimensions. The two rod types are characterized by a different number of holes: type A rods have one hole whilst type B rods have two.

Main code is reported and commented in __'Visual Inspection of Connecting Rods.ipynb'__. Below the result of the code on the provided images:
